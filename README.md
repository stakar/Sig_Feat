# Sig_Feat_Selector
Project for EEG signal's features extractor that uses Genetic Algorithm.

## Introduction

A code for my MD Thesis, which is about features selection in brain-computer interfaces based on SSVEP paradigm, using Genetic Algorithm.

Code used in this repository is taken from BakSys repository and GenAlgorithms.

## Technologies
python 3.7
numpy
sklearn

## Progress
Right now I finished first version of code and started analyzing data.
