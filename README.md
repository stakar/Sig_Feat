# SigFeatSelector
Project for EEG signal's features extractor that uses Genetic Algorithm. Used for data analysis purposes in Master's Degree Thesis

## Introduction

A code for my MD Thesis, which is about features selection in brain-computer interfaces based on SSVEP paradigm, using Genetic Algorithm.

Code used in this repository is taken from BakSys repository and GenAlgorithms.

## Technologies
python 3.7
numpy
sklearn

## Progress
Finished
